# Disease Prediction Project

The Disease Prediction project aims to create a smart tool that can predict diseases early by analyzing symptoms. Early disease detection is crucial as it significantly improves patient outcomes.

## Features

- **Disease Prediction**
  - Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on symptoms.
  
## Methods Used

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes

## Dataset

- **Target Variable:** Disease
- **Number of Rows:** 313
- **Number of Columns:** 18 (1 target variable + 16 symptoms)
- Some cells contain null values, indicating a lack of knowledge about certain symptoms.
